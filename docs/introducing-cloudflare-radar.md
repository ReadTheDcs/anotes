# Introducing Cloudflare Radar


We show the system responsible for blocking as well as the change of blocked requests over the selected time frame.

Worldwide and for individual countries we have an algorithm calculating which domains are most popular and have recently started trending (i.e. have seen a large change in popularity).

Secondly, we show Layer 7 threat information based on requests that we blocked.

You can drill down on specific countries and Cloudflare Radar will show you the change in aggregate Internet traffic seen by our network for that country.

To look up a domain or hostname in Radar by typing it in the search box within the top domains on the Radar Internet Insights Homepage.
