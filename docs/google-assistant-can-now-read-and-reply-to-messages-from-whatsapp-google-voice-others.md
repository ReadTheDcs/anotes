# Google Assistant can now read and reply to messages from WhatsApp, Google Voice, others

To try this, start by saying "read my messages" to Assistant.
According to our tipster, this has changed in the past couple of days, and Assistant will not only read text from these apps aloud but it also lets you answer them.
Previously, if you told Google Assistant "read my messages," it only read SMS texts and skipped over plenty of incoming communication from other apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, GroupMe, and so on.
From my testing, it works quite well in WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack (though you get the workspace name, not the person's), and it can even handle multiple languages in a limited capacity.
