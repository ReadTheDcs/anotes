# Anotes - useful bookmarks

This explains why it's important to bookmark a blog post's permalink rather than the homepage, archive page, article list, or category page where you originally found it. If nothing happens, download the GitHub extension for Visual Studio and try again. Use the box at the top to search your bookmarks, and the menu button to the top right to add new bookmarks, add bookmark folders (very useful for organizing), and import and export bookmarks. 

Tech news that matters to you, daily If you're not a HubSpot customer, then you can create a publishing calendar using Google Calendar and bookmark that. Even more specifically, you can make notes within your Evernote into separate bookmarks: one for your to-do list, one where you store useful snippets of HTML , one where you store inspiring articles or ebooks, and so on. 

So you can easily add new blog post ideas as you think of them, manage your own post-writing to-do list, and see what the rest of your team is working on. The other icons at the top let you create new folders for your bookmarks, or (via the settings pane) import or export bookmarks.
