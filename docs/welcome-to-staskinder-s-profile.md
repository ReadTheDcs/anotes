This capacity to consider such a wide range of price affecting elements, as well as the discipline of an emotionless automated trading system, can often lead to quite a useful and successful combination.

## Ask or tell me anything anonymously

We have found an inventive way to spot significant longer trends not by using different time frames, but point of significance within a single time frame Time is a form of asset allocation: sometimes price goes sideways.
We have been aware of algorithmic forex trading programs since the 1990s, with companies such as ED&F Man's MINT currency fund programs getting plenty of attention from institutional investors.
This usually indicates that trades either do not have a stop loss present or carry an extremely wide stop loss, either of which is potentially dangerous to your trading account.
While some trading robots are completely self-contained and run as stand-alone computer programs, others such as the popular "Expert Advisors" that operate within MetaTrader can work in conjunction with other forex market monitoring and trading software.

## Another story set free with @HaikuDeck Forex Robots.

The MT4 platform has a huge marketplace, where customised indicators and best performing robots can be purchased and sold.
The top-rated forex robots can offer ideas on how to identify profitable trades within unpredictable markets, even when the trending direction is not obvious.
It's interesting to mention that there is a blur in the line between trading indicator and robot because the latter relies heavily on the kind of market analysis that indicators do.

## What Exactly is an EA?

Genuine forex robots always require a great deal of user input.
The commands that the bots execute depend on their technical analysis tools, but good programmers make use of back testing to get optimal results.
While human traders can perceive risk in turbulent times, risk perception with forex robots does not work in the same manner.
A strategy can simply be programmed into an EA, or a forex EA generator can be used to create a new one.
